A CMSC201 project to demonstrate arrays in Java.

Locker Puzzle:
A school has 100 lockers and 100 students. As the students enter, the first student opens every locker. Then the second student begins with every second locker and closes every other locker. The third begins with the third locker and changes the status of every third locker (closes opened lockers, opened closed ones).

The pattern continues with each student n changing every nth locker. After the 100th student passes through, which lockers are still open?
